Hello I am Aagam Shah. Welcome to my blog, here I write about my experiments in infosec. They can be in Pentesting, Malware Analysis, Fuzzing etc. I also post interesting CTF challenge writeups. 

When I am not doing infosec, I like reading books on topics ranging Economics, psychology, Game theory. I also like astronomy a bit.

Well enough about me let me leave you with a shower thought.

> The word **all together** is written separately, while the word **separate** is written all together.   

Isn't that interesting ? ğŸ™‚
